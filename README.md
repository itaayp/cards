# Cards

**This is my first Elixir application. It is part of "The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp and Tutorial" course, avaliable at https://udemy.com/course/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/**

## Application goal
Using this application, you will be able to:
  1- Create a deck of cards
  2- Split a existing deck of cards into two deck
  3- Shuffle a existing deck of cards
  4- Check if a card exists in your deck
  5- Save a deck of cards in your system
  6- Load a existing deck of cards to the application
  7- Create a hand of cards (this is the join of 3 actions: Create deck, shuffle the deck and deal it)
  
## Running the application
In order to run this application, you need to install Elixir in your PC (you can install ir from the official website: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
If Elixir is already installed, you can download the source code of this application to your PC, run the following command in your terminal:
``iex -S mix``
And in order to call the functions and play with this game, I'm using exdoc to generate the Documentation. Feel free to read it and play the game!
